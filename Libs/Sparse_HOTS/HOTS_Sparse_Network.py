This file contains the HOTS_Sparse_Net class 

This Network offers the possibility to implement many iteration of original 
HOTS as proposed in the original paper here:
    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7508476
or in the Sparse HOTS paper here:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09236
as a new blend of them.

These techniques can then be used as a reference for other models as Variational
HOTS to experiment and benchmark.

        each sublayer in the previous stage. In the first layer we have a single sublayer
        (the layer itself), and since that the negative activations needs to be treated 
        independently, in the next layer we have to train 2 sublayers that will deal
        with both polarity, that will respectivelty generate 2 polarity events each.

    # dataset: the input dataset the network will respond to
    # labels: the labels used for the classification task (positive integers from 0 to N)
    # number_of_labels: the maximum number of labels of the dataset
    # method : string with the method you want to use :
    #          "CG" for Coniugate Gradient Descent
    #          "Exp distance" for the model with lateral inhibition and explicit
    #           exponential distance computing
    # noise_ratio: The model responses can be mixed with noise, it can improve  
    #               learning speed 
    # sparsity_coeff: The model presents lateral inhibtion between the basis,
    #                 it selects a winner depending on the responses, and feed 
    #                 back it's activity timed minus the sparsity_coeff to 
    #                 inhibit the neighbours. a value near one will result
    #                 in a Winner-Takes-All mechanism like on the original 
    #                 HOTS (For CG it's implemented as a weighted L1 coinstraint
    #                 on the activations in the Error function)
    # sensitivity : Each activation is computed as a guassian distance between 
    #               a base and the upcoming timesurface, this coefficient it's
    #               the gaussian 'variance' and it modulates cell selectivity
    #               to their encoded feature (Feature present only on Exp distance)   
    # verbose : If set to True the function will provide written feedback on the 
    #           percentage of the dataset computed
    # It returns the computed distances per batch (Euclidean, normalized Euclidean
    # and Bhattacharyyan) and the predicted_labels per batch and per metric(distance)
