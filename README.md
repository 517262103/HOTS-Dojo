# Sparse-HOTS
Python implementation of the Sparse HOTS paper and testbench for improved algorithms based on it
Please note that probably in future works this set of algorithms will be referred as Compressive HOTS, as they add possibility of having multiple centers or features per layer responding at the same input time-surface, therefore reducing the number of centers or features to succesfully represent the same data.
